**Smart Voting System Using Blockchain Technology**

## **Project Overview:**
The Smart Voting System Using Blockchain Technology is an innovative online voting platform that aims to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient method for conducting elections. This system uses blockchain technology to ensure that each vote is accurately recorded and securely stored, eliminating the risks associated with traditional voting methods such as fraud, tampering, and inefficiencies.

## **Features:**

### **Blockchain Integration:** 
Utilizes blockchain technology to securely record each vote as a transaction, ensuring immutability and transparency.

### **Multi-Layered Authentication:** 
Voter verification through multiple levels of security:
- Voter ID Verification
- Aadhaar OTP verification
- Facial recognition

### **Cryptographic Security:** 
SHA-256 hashing for securing votes and voter information.

### **User-Friendly Voting Interface:** 
A simple and intuitive web-based interface for casting votes, reviewing selections, and confirming choices.

### **Tamper-Proof Voting Process:** 
Each vote is recorded on the blockchain, making it impossible to alter once recorded.

## **System Architecture:**
The voting system is composed of several key modules:

### **User Authentication Module:**
Ensures secure login with Voter ID, Aadhaar, and face recognition.

### **Verification Module:**
Cross-verifies the voterâ€™s details using a combination of Voter ID, Aadhaar number, and facial recognition technology.

### **Voting Interface Module:**
Provides a web-based interface for casting votes, including real-time verification and feedback mechanisms.

### **Blockchain Integration Module:**
Records each vote as a transaction on the blockchain, providing a transparent and immutable ledger of votes.

## **Technologies Used:**

### **Programming Languages:**
- Python
- JavaScript

### **Web Technologies:**
- HTML
- CSS

### **Cryptography:**
- SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm)
- RSA Encryption

## **How It Works:**
1. Voters log in with their Voter ID and Aadhaar, followed by facial recognition for added security.
2. Upon successful verification, the voter is given a digital ballot to cast their vote.
3. Votes are encrypted using RSA encryption and recorded as transactions on the blockchain.
4. Each vote is securely stored and can be verified by authorized parties, ensuring transparency and security.
